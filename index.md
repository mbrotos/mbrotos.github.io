## About me

I am an applied machine learning researcher focused on turning rigorous research into production-ready systems. I currently pursue a thesis-based MSc in Computer Science (AI) at Toronto Metropolitan University as a Vector Institute Scholar, with experience spanning industry, healthcare, public sector, and research labs. My work combines deep learning, reinforcement learning, and probabilistic modeling to solve real-world problems under practical constraints such as data sparsity, privacy, and measurable business impact. I am seeking near-term applied scientist roles where research directly informs deployed decision-making systems.

## Highlights

- **Education:** MSc in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence), Toronto Metropolitan University (thesis-based)  
- **Research:** Author on peer-reviewed and submitted work in applied ML (ICDE, TPAMI), including sequence-to-sequence modeling, predictive systems, and optimization  
- **Industry Impact:** Shipped and evaluated ML systems in production environments at Intuit, Synaptive Medical, and public-sector health research initiatives  
- **Recognition:** Vector Scholarship in Artificial Intelligence (2023–24); multiple academic excellence and merit-based awards  
- **Focus Areas:** Applied ML research, deep learning, reinforcement learning, NLP, privacy-aware and data-limited learning
